# 👋 Hey there, we’re Polrambora

We’re a small creative team that loves to experiment, build, and share.
Polrambora actually started out as an AI-focused project, but along the way we realized something: what really excites us isn’t automation, it’s **human creativity**.

So we changed paths.
Now we’re a hub for making things that feel personal, playful, and alive - whether that’s a game, a piece of art, a song, or some quirky web experiment.

## 🚀 What We Do

### 🎮 Games

We’re exploring game design and development with **Unreal Engine 5** (or other), building interactive worlds and stories.

### 🎨 Graphics & Design

Digital art, 3D visuals, design experiments - we love turning ideas into visuals that pop.

### 🎶 Music & Sound

Original tracks, soundscapes, and audio experiments to bring our creations to life.

### 🌐 Web & Interactive

We also create fun web projects and interactive experiences - sometimes as previews, sometimes just for the joy of making.

## 💡 Our Values

* **Creativity first** – we’d rather make something weird and personal than polished but empty.
* **Collaboration** – different skills, different voices, one shared project.
* **Quality with heart** – we care about the details, but we care even more about the feeling it leaves behind.
